Rally Productivity Chart
======================

![Title](https://raw.github.com/RallyApps/ProductivityChart/master/screenshots/title-screenshot.png)

## Overview

The Productivity Chart displays a rate of productivity for a team during the last 15 iterations. 

## How to Use

### Running the App

If you want to start using the app immediately, create an Custom HTML app on your Rally dashboard. Then copy App.html from the deploy folder into the HTML text area. That's it, it should be ready to use. See [this](http://www.rallydev.com/help/use_apps#create) help link if you don't know how to create a dashboard page for Custom HTML apps.

Or you can just click [here](https://raw.github.com/RallyApps/ProductivityChart/master/deploy/App.html) to find the file and copy it into the custom HTML app.

### Using the App

The chart can be used with velocity metrics to estimate future iteration capacity during planning.

<b>NOTE</b>: Due to differences in estimation strategies and point scales from one scrum team to the next, the productivity rate should not be used to compare the productivity of multiple teams. It can and should only be used to measure changes in productivity for individual teams.

## Customize this App

You're free to customize this app to your liking (see the License section for details). Since this app uses a very old version of Rally's SDK, the app is only presented in its deployed form.
